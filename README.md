# Wandering-Knight

## Description
<p>This is a WIP project where I determine the minimum number of moves for a knight on a chessboard to move from one square to
another with Breadth First Search. I have based this project in JavaScript.</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, I have implemented a visualizer to plan the Graph data structure out as seen below.</p>

<p>The chessboard is drawn out with red lines connecting the squares. Each red line represents a possible move a knight chess piece could
make from the given square.</p>

<h2>Project History</h2>
<p>I started this project in late September 2022 to work on outside of class to refresh my data structure skills and apply them
in JavaScript for the first time.</p>

## How to use
<p>Due to the project being web-based, on launch this will be avalable on a live website which will be added here.</p>

<h2>Endgame</h2>
<p>I see the end result of this project to become a puzzle-game of sorts. I would like for the user to try and guess the fewest moves a knight could make and compare it to the algorithm.</p>
